## Releases and Builds

Releases will be tagged as such. Builds will be found under /Latest Builds for each branch or commit.

### master

Stable and tested code. Code will be merged into master when released. 
Released will have a tag, and any intermittent *hotfixes* will be commited and tagged into master when needed.

### develop

This is the "bleeding edge" branch. Code committed/merged into develop is likely OK to use, but not as tested and polished as what's found in master. 

### feature/*

Code found under any feature/* branch is most likely not completed enough to use. These branches can appear and dissapear without notice and may contain experimental stuff. Unless you're testing a very specific new feature, don't use the latest builds from these.
